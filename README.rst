pyatari800 and the atari800 shared memory driver
================================================

A new shared-memory driver for the cross-platform Atari 8-bit emulator atari800
allowing custom front-ends in any language that supports shared memory access.
It provides two-way communication to the underlying emulator, sending inputs to
the core and receiving the screen and sound information for every frame.

As an example, pyatari800 is a python wrapper that has no user interface
dependencies, and can be used by any python program or GUI toolkit.

As a further example, there is a small demo front-end for wxPython that will
operate on all 3 major platforms: Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.


Prerequisites
=============

atari800-shmem
--------------

* C compiler

pyatari800
----------

* python 2.7 (but not 3.x yet) capable of building C extensions
* numpy

Optionally:

* Cython (only if you want to modify the .pyx files)

The wxPython front-end additionally requires:

* wxPython 3.0.2 (classic, not Phoenix yet)
* pyopengl


Installation
============

pyatari800 will eventually be available through PyPI, but currently you have to
compile from source::

    git clone https://github.com/robmcmullen/pyatari800.git
    cd pyatari800/python
    python setup.py sdist && python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Your version of python must be able to build C extensions, which should be
automatic in most linux and on OS X. You may have to install the python
development packages on linux distributions like Ubuntu or Linux Mint.

Windows doesn't come with a C compiler, but happily Microsoft provides a
command line version of their Visual Studio compiler just for compiling Python
extensions! Download and install it from `here
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266>`_.

Windows compatibility code was used in pyatari800:

* Dirent (a windows port of dirent.h) from https://github.com/tronkko/dirent
  and licensed under the MIT license which is GPL compatible


Embedding in other programs
===========================

The shared memory ("shmem") target is designed to be an interface between the
atari800 emulator core and some other programming language. If the language can
compile C extensions (like Python can) and can create shared memory blocks, you
should be able to control and view the atari800 emulator from within your
program.

My use case was embedding the emulator in a Python program so that I could
display the emulated screen inside my program. Longer term goals were to be
able to step through the code and create a GUI debugger as in the `Altirra
emulator <http://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html>`_, except unlike Altirra
would be cross-platform.

I chose shared memory rather than direct function calls to the emulator to
allow the emulator to be run in a separate thread or process to allow the
wrapper program to remain in control even if the emulator should hang or crash.

The operation of the shmem platform requires the wrapper program to create a
block of shared memory at least ``SHMEM_TOTAL_SIZE`` bytes long (aligned to a
32 bit boundary if the platform requires it to access 32 bit values) and pass
the address into the initialization routine, ``start_shmem``. This initializes
the emulator (through the ``Atari800_Initialise`` routine that also initializes
all of the shmem components) and generates the first frame of the emulation.

The shared memory block is broken up into sections: the input section, the
video section, and the sound section. The input section is 128 bytes long and
is the only section that the emulator will read from. The other sections are
only used to transfer data from the emulator to the wrapper. This section has
specific offsets into the shared memory block to allow the wrapper program to
set everything that the emulator needs for input: key values, joystick values,
special keys, and mouse buttons.

It also includes 2 special locations: one location that the shmem target uses
to report the current frame count (that should be treated as read-only by the
wrapper), and one semaphore location that is writable by both the wrapper and
emulator and used to synchronize between the two. This ``main_semaphore``
location can take 3 values:

* 0: wrapper sets the value to 0 when all input is ready to be processed, signaling to the emulator that it should generate the next frame
* 1: the emulator changes the value to 1 when the next frame is ready
* 255: exit the emulator

The semaphore is initialized at 0 so the first frame of emulation is
automatically generated after platform initialization. The wrapper can do other
things while the emulator is generating the frame, periodically checking for a
1 in ``main_semaphore``. The wrapper will have to check quite often, of course,
because frames happen 50 or 60 times per second. In my example wxPython
wrapper, I implement this check as a poll and sleep loop where it sleeps .001
seconds before checking again.

Detecting a 1 means that the emulator is reporting that the screen is ready to
be shown and any sound samples are ready to be played. The wrapper gets the
data out of the video and sound areas of the shared memory and presents them to
the user in whatever wrapper-specific ways it can.

The data in the video area is a 336x240 pixel array in the same format as the
internal ``Screen_atari`` array: one byte per pixel where the byte is one of
the Atari colors. It's up to the wrapper to convert the Atari color to an RGB
value to be displayed to the user.

The sound support is still under development, so currently no sound is returned
to the wrapper although some space has been reserved in the shared memory
block.

As quickly an the wrapper can, it should set the ``main_semaphore`` to 0 to
indicate to the emulator that it can start its timing loop before generating
the next frame.

The wrapper is also responsible for getting user input to the emulator. During
the time after setting ``main_semaphore`` to 0, where the wrapper is otherwise
waiting for the emulator to report 1, it should be polling or using events to
determine what keys have been pressed and if there has been any joystick or
mouse activity that should be reported.

This loop happens for the duration of the emulation, until the wrapper sets
``main_semaphore`` to 255, which will exit the emulator.

A feature of this semaphore system is that it's easy to implement a pause
feature: simply wait to report a 0 and the emulation will be frozen in time.

Example embedding: Python and wxPython
--------------------------------------

If you check out the pyatari800 source from the git repository::

    git clone https://github.com/robmcmullen/pyatari800.git

you will need to build the C extension with::

    cd python
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

A simple wxPython front-end is included as ``wxatari.py`` and when run on the
command line, will pass through any arguments to the atari800 core. E.g.::

    python wxatari.py -pal jumpman.atr

which will run Jumpman in PAL mode in the wxPython window (assuming you have
the ATR image of Jumpman as jumpman.atr, of course.  See `Atarimania
<http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-400-800-xl-xe-jumpman_2713.html>`_, for
example).

I have used `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_ as the interface between Python and
the C code, but I have included the latest version of the C code that was
generated from the .pyx file. You'll only need to install Cython if you want to
modify pyatari800 and change the .pyx file. If you do, the .pyx file is
compiled to C as a side effect of using the command::

    cd python
    python setup.py sdist

The display code uses OpenGL 2.0 and OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) 1.2 to
display the emulated screen because converting the screen array to RGB and
copying that to the screen bitmap was fast enough only when the screen wasn't
scaled. OpenGL handles the scaling automatically, and as a bonus, GLSL allows
the GPU to do the color conversion to RGB so the only data that has to be
passed to the graphics card is the raw 336x240 byte array. This is much faster
than directly copying to the screen. The screen copy version does still exist
for reference purposes.

.. note::

   OpenGL 2.0 and GLSL 1.2 are very old versions, but wxPython's OpenGL support
   seems to be limited to these old versions even if your graphics card
   supports newer versions, which it probably does.

Testing the C Code
==================

The shared memory "platform" is designed to be used as an embedded module for a
larger program, so it's not really useful as a standalone platform for the
atari800 executable. But for demo purposes a sample version can be compiled
that will prove the platform is working: it will capture every display frame
and convert the upper left corner of the screen into ASCII characters that will
be displayed in the terminal.

If you check out the code from the git repository, you will have to build a few
files that are included with source distributions but are not in the repository
because they are generated files.

After checking out the source with::

    git clone https://github.com/robmcmullen/pyatari800.git

the configure script must be created with::

    cd atari800/src
    ./autogen.sh

From there, it's the normal GNU-style build::

    ./configure --target=shmem
    make
    ./atari800
